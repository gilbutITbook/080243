Interpret a sequence of bytes in {\itshape c} as mb character and return that as wide character through {\itshape C}.

\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
the length of the mb character or \code{-1} if an encoding error occured.
\end{DoxyReturn}
This function can be integrated into a sequence of such searches through a string, as long as the same {\itshape state} argument passed to all calls to this or similar functions.

\begin{DoxyRemark}{Remarks}
{\itshape state} of \code{0} indicates that {\itshape c} can be scanned without considering any context.
\end{DoxyRemark}
