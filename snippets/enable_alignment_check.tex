enable alignment check for i386 processors

Intel's i386 processor family is quite tolerant in accepting misalignment of data. This can lead to irritating bugs when ported to other architectures that are not as tolerant.

This function enables a check for this problem also for this family or processors, such that you can be sure to detect this problem early.

I found that code on Ygdrasil's blog: \href{http://orchistro.tistory.com/206}{\tt http://orchistro.tistory.com/206}
