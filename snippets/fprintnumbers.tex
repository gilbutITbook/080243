print a series of numbers {\itshape nums} on {\itshape stream}, using \code{printf} format {\itshape form}, separated by {\itshape sep} characters and terminated with a newline character.

\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
the number of characters printed to {\itshape stream}, or a negative error value on error.
\end{DoxyReturn}
If {\itshape len} is \code{0}, an empty line is printed and \code{1} is returned.

Possible error returns are:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \code{EOF} (which is negative) if {\itshape stream} was not ready to be written to
\item \code{-EOVERFLOW} if more than \code{INT\_MAX} characters would have to be written, including the case that {\itshape len} is greater than \code{INT\_MAX}.
\item \code{-EFAULT} if {\itshape stream} or {\itshape numb} are \code{0}
\item \code{-ENOMEM} if a memory error occurred
\end{DoxyItemize}

This function leaves \code{errno} to the same value as occurred on entry.
