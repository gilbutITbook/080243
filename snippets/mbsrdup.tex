Interpret a sequence of bytes in {\itshape s} as mb string and convert it to a wide character string.

\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
a newly malloc'ed wide character string of the appropriate length, \code{0} if an encoding error occurred.
\end{DoxyReturn}
\begin{DoxyRemark}{Remarks}
This function can be integrated into a sequence of such searches through a string, as long as a {\itshape state} argument is passed to this function that is consistent with the mb character starting in {\itshape c}. The state itself is not modified by this function.

{\itshape state} of \code{0} indicates that {\itshape s} can be scanned without considering any context.
