Interpret a mb string in {\itshape mbs} and return its length when interpreted as a wide character string.

\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
the length of the mb string or \code{-1} if an encoding error occured.
\end{DoxyReturn}
This function can be integrated into a sequence of searches through a string, as long as a {\itshape state} argument is passed to this function that is consistent with the mb character starting in {\itshape mbs}. The state itself is not modified by this function.

\begin{DoxyRemark}{Remarks}
{\itshape state} of \code{0} indicates that {\itshape mbs} can be scanned without considering any context.
