Interpret a sequence of bytes in {\itshape s} as mb string and search for wide character {\itshape C}.

\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
the {\itshape occurrence'th} position in {\itshape s} that starts a mb sequence corresponding to {\itshape C} or \code{0} if an encoding error occurred.
\end{DoxyReturn}
If the number of occurrences is less than {\itshape occurrence} the last such position is returned. So in particular using \code{SIZE\_MAX} (or \code{-1}) will always return the last occurrence.

\begin{DoxyRemark}{Remarks}
This function can be integrated into a sequence of such searches through a string, as long as the same {\itshape state} argument passed to all calls to this or similar functions and as long as the continuation of the search starts at the position that is returned by this function.

{\itshape state} of \code{0} indicates that {\itshape s} can be scanned without considering any context.
\end{DoxyRemark}
